				<h1>CS 498: Data Visualization</h1>
				
				<p> By SangJin Hyun</p>
				
				<h2>Coffee Dataset Visualization</h2>
				<p>Dataset Publicly available on https://github.com/SangJinHyun/DataViz</p>
				
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The visualization focuses on providing viewpoints for different aspects of coffee graphical representation.</p>
				<p>Coffee is widely consumed as a beverage across the world.</p>
				<p>The produced graphs work to provide a small picture of the larger names(countries) that interact with coffee.</p>
				<p>These countries partake in coffee and the contributors of it through various means do as well.</p>
				<h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
				<p>The visualization focuses on the interactive slide slow representation.</p>
				<p>A user may interact with each provided scene by means of the buttons.</p> 
				<h2>Scenes</h2>
				<p>The scenes are the summary, disappearance, imports, and exports. The first setups up the visualization with some background knowledge. The disappearance is what others may relate to – the consumption of coffee. The others don’t have a great 
					importance of ordering but do provide background into the coffee visualization.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scene 1 focuses on disappearance - providing an overview of some countries in that detail</li>
						<li>Scene 2 focuses on imports - providing an overview of the largest importers by country</li>
						<li>Scene 3 focuses on exports - where the countries that export may differ from the other metrics</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h2>Annotations</h2>
				<p>The annotations provide some of the specific numeric values that may go beyond a graph.</p>
				<p>The annotations may provide insight into certain countries compared to other ones as a part of the graphs.</p> 
				
				<h2>Parameters</h2>
				<p>The navigation begins with the main page detailing the complementary essay giving some background into the narration.</p>
				<p>Following that, the user may click a button to access the narrative visualization.</p>
				<p>This takes them through disappearance of coffee followed by a couple other aspects of coffee visualization.</p>
				<p>The buttons help transition to each segment of the coffee graphics which separates them, making each “slide” the main point of the user’s focus.</p> 
				
				<h2>Triggers</h2>
				<p>Triggers are relative to defined values – such as where the graphs are placed constant to how the graph should be presented.</p>
				<p>The graphs should be the focal point of the visualization,allowing them to take up most of the page that presents the display.</p>
