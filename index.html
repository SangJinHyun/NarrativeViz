				<h1>CS 498: Data Visualization</h1>
				
				<p> By SangJin Hyun</p>
				
				<h2>Coffee Dataset Visualization</h2>
				<p>Dataset Publicly available on https://github.com/SangJinHyun/DataViz</p>
				
				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>The visualization focuses on providing viewpoints for different aspects of coffee graphical representation.</p>
				<p>Coffee is widely consumed as a beverage across the world. The produced graphs work to provide a small picture of the larger names(countries) 
					that partake in coffee and the contributors of it through various means.</p>
				<h2>Narrative Structure</h2>
				<p>The visualization focuses on the interactive slide slow representation – where a user may interact with each provided scene by means of buttons..</p>
				
				<h2>Scenes</h2>
				<p>The scenes are the summary, disappearance, imports, and exports. The first setups up the visualization with some background knowledge. The disappearance is what others may relate to – the consumption of coffee. The others don’t have a great 
					importance of ordering but do provide background into the coffee visualization.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scene 1 focuses on disappearance</li>
						<li>Scene 2 focuses on imports</li>
						<li>Scene 3 focuses on exports</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<h2>Annotations</h2>
				<p>The annotations provide some of the specific numeric values that may go beyond a graph and its means and relate to a graph’s overall representation. </p>
				
				<h2>Parameters</h2>
				<p>The navigation begins with the main page detailing the complementary essay giving some background into the narration. Following that, the user may click a button to access the narrative visualization, which takes them through disappearance of coffee followed by a couple other aspects of coffee visualization. The buttons help transition to each segment of the coffee graphics which separates them, making each “slide” the main point of the user’s focus. If the user wants to continue to another slide, they select the button corresponding to the title they wish to pursue. </p>
				
				<h2>Triggers</h2>
				<p>Triggers are relative to defined values – such as where the graphs are placed constant to how the graph should be presented. The graphs should be the focal point of the visualization, 
					allowing them to take up most of the page that presents the display.</p>
